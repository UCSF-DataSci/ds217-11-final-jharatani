KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY
====================

MODEL PERFORMANCE:
- Best performing model: XGBoost
  • Reason: Highest R² on test data (R² = 0.9154)
  • Lowest prediction error among all models (RMSE = 2.9111 °C)
- Linear Regression performance:
  • Showed significant overfitting (Train R² >> Test R²)
  • Unable to capture nonlinear relationships in weather data
- Overall: Tree-based boosting captured nonlinear and interaction effects better than linear models.

FEATURE IMPORTANCE:
- Most important feature: Wet Bulb Temperature (importance: 0.8095)
- Top 3 features account for 95.09% of total importance.
- Temporal features (hour, month, rolling averages) contributed strongly.
- Derived features improved predictive power for temperature modeling.

TEMPORAL PATTERNS:
- Strong daily temperature cycle (higher midday, lower nighttime).
- Seasonal variation across months clearly observed.
- Rolling 24-hour averages revealed smoother long-term trends.

DATA QUALITY:
- Dataset cleaned: 196,321 → 193,971 rows
- Missing values handled via forward-fill/backfill
- Outliers identified using quantiles and removed/capped accordingly
- Final dataset contains no NaN values in training or test splits.

OVERALL INSIGHT:
- Weather sensor data is highly predictive of air temperature.
- XGBoost effectively captures nonlinear and temporal dependencies.
