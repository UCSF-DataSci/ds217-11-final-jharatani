Outlier Handling:
Detection method: Percentile-based thresholds (0.1–99.9th percentiles)
Columns with outliers: Air Temperature, Wet Bulb Temperature, Humidity, Rain Intensity, Interval Rain, Total Rain, Wind Speed, Maximum Wind Speed, Barometric Pressure, Solar Radiation, Battery Life
Method used: Capped outliers to percentile bounds (winsorization)
